# Wintr Travel main website

Wintr Travel's ambition was to modernize the ski rental industry. With this in mind, one of their main objectives was to offer
their customers the most pleasant user experience possible during the booking process for their ski holiday.

Unfortunately for them, the covid-19 pandemic took its toll on their business, but I kept a demo version of the work I've done here.
